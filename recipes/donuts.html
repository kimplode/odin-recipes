        If you love robots and German culture, you'll love Fasnacht! The annual celebration takes place in the quiet town of Helvetia. Oral history dictates the festival exists in the 21st century, although with fewer robots. Here, we'll substitute the frog eggs with chicken eggs. You'll need a few more and some additional ingredients to make it palatable for your time. 21st century equivalent adaptation obtained courtesy of <a href="https://www.acoalcrackerinthekitchen.com/">https://www.acoalcrackerinthekitchen.com/</a>.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound russet potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups white sugar (plus more for coating, if desired)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 (1/4 ounce) envelopes active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2/3 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>6 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>Powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar for dusting as needed, if desired</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan, cover with cold water by 2 inches and season generously with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until very tender.</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes RESERVING 1 and 1/2 cups of the potato cooking water. Drain and mash the potatoes until smooth (do not use milk, butter or other seasoning â€“ just mash the cooked potato). Set the mashed potatoes aside and cool slightly.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the mashed potatoes, reserved potato cooking water, sugar and yeast. Cover with a towel and let the mixture sit for 20 minutes; it will look foamy.</li>
            <li>Using a sieve, strain the mixture into a large bowl, smoothing out any lumps. Stir in the eggs and melted butter.</li>
            <li>Stir 5 cups of the flour, 1 cup at a time, until a dough starts to form.  Gently knead the remaining 1 cup of flour in until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms a large ball. Cover with a towel and put in a warm place to rise for 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Dust some flour onto a baking sheet. Set aside.</li>
            <li>On a well-floured surface, roll out the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Cut into 3 inch squares or 3 inch rounds. (Squares result in less waste and re-working of dough.) Set on the floured baking sheet. Cover lightly with a towel, and let rise for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with a brown paper bag or paper towel for draining of the fried fasnachts.</li>
            <li>In a deep fryer or Dutch oven, pour enough oil to fill no more than halfway up the side. Heat the oil to 365F degrees.</li>
            <li>Place the fasnachts into the heated oil, two at a time. Cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer using a slotted spoon or spider to the lined baking sheet to absorb some of the oil.</li>
            <li>While slightly warm, place the fasnachts into a paper bag with a spoonful of cinnamon sugar and shake gently until well coated or lightly dust powdered sugar on tops. Coating is optional, you may leave some or all plain.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
