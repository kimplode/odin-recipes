    <p>Full English Breakfast</p>
    <p>Also known as a Fry Up, there are a number of regional variations to the recipe. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pork sausages</li>
        <li>1 tomato</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 slices back bacon</li>
        <li>110g (3.9 oz) mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 (220g) (7.8 oz) tin baked beans</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 slices white or brown bread</li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set the oven to preheat to 220°C/430°F or gas 7.</li>
        <li>Place a pan over medium heat and once it has warmed, brown the sausages on every side, then cook them for five minutes. Next, put them in a baking dish and bake for 10 minutes in the oven.</li>
        <li>With a knife make a cross on the bottom of the tomato, then place in the baking tray together with the sausages, cross side up. Bake the tomato and the sausages for 10 minutes, then turn the heat off and leave them inside the oven, so they remain warm.</li>
        <li>In the same frying pan in which you’ve fried the sausages, first melt a tablespoon of butter, then fry mushrooms and bacon over high heat for seven minutes. Once the mushrooms have softened, and the bacon is crispy transfer them to the oven, so they keep warm.</li>
        <li>Add the beans to a small saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Lastly, fry the egg, taking care that the yolk does not break and toast the bread, then spread the remaining butter over the toast.</li>
        <li>Arrange the ingredients — sausages, bacon, beans, tomato, mushrooms, fried egg, and toast — on a warm platter, then season with salt and pepper and serve.</li>
    </ol>
