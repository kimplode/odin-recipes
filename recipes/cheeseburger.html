    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Thought to have been invented in the early 1920's in California by a young man, the cheeseburger is an American staple.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Burger</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger potato buns</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>homemade sauce (see below)</li>
        <li>4 pieces green-leaf lettuce</li>
        <li>8 ¼-inch slices plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 pound cold ground beef, formed into four 1-inch-thick pucks</li>
        <li>4 slices of American cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Burger Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup Hellman's mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Heinz ketchup</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher dill pickle brine</li>
        <li>Pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the burger sauce: In a small bowl, stir all of the sauce ingredients until smooth, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the burgers: Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat. Meanwhile, open the hamburger buns and brush both sides liberally with the melted butter. Working in 2 batches, place the buns onto the heated skillet, buttered-sides down, and cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and spoon 1 tablespoon of sauce on each top bun, along with a piece of lettuce and 2 slices of tomato.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat to medium and let the pan heat up for 2 to 3 minutes. On a plate, season both sides of each puck of ground beef with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the pucks into the cast-iron skillet, leaving plenty of room between them. Using a large, sturdy metal spatula, firmly smash each puck into a ⅓-inch-thick round patty. Cook the burgers without touching them until the edges are brown and crisp, 2½ minutes, then flip them. Place a slice of American cheese on each burger and continue to cook until medium, 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Transfer a cheeseburger to each bottom bun, then sandwich with the top bun and lettuce and tomato, and serve.</li>
