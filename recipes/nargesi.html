    <p>Although it is commonly referred to is <b>Welsh Rabbit</b> there is no meat involved. Welsh Rarebit is said to
    have been documented as early as the 1500s as ‘caws pobi’, which is Welsh for toasted cheese. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>120ml brown ale</li>
        <li>25g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>25g plain flour</li>
        <li>140g mature cheddar</li>
        <li>1 tsp English mustard powder (such as Coleman's)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chopped chives</li>
        <li>2 large slices of sourdough bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan gently warm the ale, set aside. Take another small saucepan and over a medium heat melt the butter until it begins to foam, tip in the flour and stir everything together, cooking for 1 min. Whisk in the warm ale in several additions to create a thick sauce then whisk through the cheese to create a thick paste. Stir the mustard, Worcestershire and chives through the sauce.</li>
        <li>Heat a grill to its highest setting. Place the slices of bread on a flat baking sheet and grill on one side until golden brown. Flip the bread over and spread each one with the cheese mixture. Place back under the grill and cook for a further 1-2 mins or until golden brown and bubbling, serve immediately.</li>
